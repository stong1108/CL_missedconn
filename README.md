### Contents
**NLP_scripts**<br>
Contains files for content analysis of Missed Connections (see its [README](https://github.com/stong1108/CL_missedconn/tree/master/NLP_scripts) for more info).

**webapp**<br>
Contains files for the Missed Connections Explorer web app.

**saved_maps**<br>
Contains html files for interactive maps.

**MissedConn.py**<br>
Class file for a Missed Connections scraper object.

A MissedConn object scrapes Craigslist Missed Connections for a given city. Initialize an object with the url of a city's Craigslist Missed Connections page.

Attributes:
+ `starturl`: url of a Craigslist Missed Connections page used to initialize MissedConn object (e.g. "https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/mis")
+ `city`: city of the Missed Connections object (e.g. "sfbay")
+ `record_dt`: datetime of when the post was scraped
+ `df`: DataFrame that is populated in the scraping process

Methods:
+ `get_df(update=False)`: Populates and returns self.df with Missed Connection post info. If update is True, the object will only scrape the city's Missed Connections up until the last recorded datetime stored in the PostgreSQL database.

Example:
```
mc = MissedConn('https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/mis')
df = mc.get_df()
```
*after some time passes, update*
```
df2 = mc.get_df(update=True)
```
